        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm <strong>Ahmed Kaafi</strong>, a passionate junior front-end
          developer who loves turning designs into beautiful, interactive
          websites.
        </p>

        <p>
          I recently started my journey in web development and have built
          projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a bit of React. I'm
          constantly learning and improving by building real-world websites and
          exploring new tools.
        </p>

        <p>
          My goal is to create clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites
          that solve problems and provide a great user experience.
        </p>

        <h3>🛠️ Skills</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript</li>
          <li>Responsive Web Design</li>
          <li>Git & GitHub</li>
          <li>Basic React.js</li>
          <li>Working with Figma Designs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>📌 Why Front-End?</h3>
        <p>
          I enjoy seeing instant results from code and love making things look
          great and work well. Front-end development allows me to be both
          creative and logical — it's the perfect balance for me.
        </p>

        <h3>🌱 What’s Next?</h3>
        <p>
          I’m currently focused on improving my JavaScript and learning more
          about accessibility and performance. My dream is to join a team where
          I can grow, build useful apps, and collaborate with other developers.
        </p>
